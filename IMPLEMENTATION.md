# Selecting Maze Game:

Initially, the plan was to use an existing, open source maze game running on the pygame library since it would be easy to integrate into a Jupyter Notebook running Python. A game called [PyMaze](https://www.pygame.org/project/733) was found, downloaded, and tested in Pycharm to ensure that it could run properly and handle user inputs.

When the game was transferred to a Jupyter Notebook in Google Colab, a major issue was discovered.
